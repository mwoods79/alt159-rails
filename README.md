# alt159-rails

## Hooray for Saturdays!!

Do you want all of ALT159's goodness in your rails app? _Of course you
do!!_  Good news!  We made it really simple.

    # Gemfile
    gem 'alt159-rails'

Wow, that was almost too easy...  Oh wait it was, one more step, add
ALT159 to your application manifest.

    # app/assets/javascripts/application.js
    //= ALT159

This is a coffeescript only module, so if you need it in plain js, do
the normal thing.  Download the `js` file and add it to your app.
